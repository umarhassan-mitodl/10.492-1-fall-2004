  caption: Are the manipulated variables sufficient to overcome disturbances? This
    plot shows the demands on hot and cold flow for various combinations of disturbances
    to a system. The disturbance combination is expressed as an angle, and the required
    flows are within limits in all cases. (Graph courtesy of Dr. Barry S. Johnston.
